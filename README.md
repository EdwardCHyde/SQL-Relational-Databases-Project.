# SQL-Relational-Databases-Project.

# Overview

This project is to demonstrate sqlite and connecting to a database. This project shows the ability to insert, modify, delete, and retrieve data. This is done with an example of a student information storage program that takes the student's name, id, and GPA and stores them in the database. 

The software for this project is functional-based with one class, This provides a simple solution to accessing the database with user input.

The purpose of this software is to help me (the developer) understand how to connect to a database, create tables, and interact with the items in the table

# Relational Database

The database used for this project is a local file on a computer. The reason for this is to demonstrate learning more than functionality.

The structure of the tables contains four elements, first name, last name, student id, and GPA .

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code
Programming language: Python.
Libraries included: sqlite3 which allows the program to connect and interact with the database in SQL.

# Useful Websites

* [Python.org](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/sqlite3.html)
* [sqlitetutorial.net](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/)

# Future Work

* Item 1 Make a better interface with Tkinter.
* Item 2 Make more editing options. 
* Item 3 Connect to a cloud SQL database.
